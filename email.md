You can reach out about anything! No I’m serious anything! Literally anything at all! I’m serious! Anything you want to talk about, just reach out!

Please for god’s sake someone just talk to me please. I am begging you. Just say something it could literally be anything. Please I need more human interaction in my life.

Examples of things you can say that we can talk about: “you’re so funny”, “you’re so cool”, “You have lots of good qualities”, “you are actually very attractive upon contrary belief”, “You are very intelligent and smart”, “You have lots of cool and interesting things to say”, “you are my friend” (this is my favorite one)
