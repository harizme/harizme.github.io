I want you guys to do me a favor. Go to your parents (unless you are an orphan) and ask them when they first started loving you. If they give you that bullshit of “Oh I knew I loved you as soon as your mother pushed you out of the womb and I held you in my hands”, then you know they’re lying. Newborn babies are so ugly. There is no way anyone loves one of them right when they enter this world. I actually have a problem with this because on numerous occasion I’ve accidently hit newborn infants because they startled me with how gross they are. All snotty and wrinkly. They should have just stayed in the womb until they were ready to confidently show their face in this world.

I came to this shocking reality when my mom was giving me her life story the other day and she briefly mentioned “then your dad started to love you and then we moved away from California … anyways California was great! It was…”, and then just continued to tell the story like nothing happened.  I was like “hold up, how old was I when this happened”, and she nonchalantly says “I don’t know, like when you were 4?” and then continues to talk about how cozy her new home of Minnesota was.

_My father didn’t start loving me… until I was 4 fucking years old._ She said I was too fragile for my dad to hold and that it made him uncomfortable, which makes sense considering I was literally his own child and spawn into this world. She said he didn’t like how I couldn’t move my arms. Sorry I wasn’t physically and cognitively able to throw hands at other infant children, dad, at least I started doing that when I turned 18. I guess he just thought it was cute how I was wobbling around and it made me seem more human than when I looked like one of those ugly ass newborns.

Now I think my dad is overcompensating for this. He literally calls me and texts me all the time for no reason. Like just the other day he called me to say “Hey can you please pick up my prescription from the pharmacy, I need it immediately as I may go under cardiac arrest within the next 24 hours without it”. Like okkkkk calm dowwwwn, out here acting like it’s the end of the world.

Anyways, If your parents ever told you they loved you all of your life they are definitely lying. They might not even love you currently. At least they’re pretending to make you feel better, and that’s all that matters.
