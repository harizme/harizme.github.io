description: So today I got the news that all employees that work for Juul Labs will be getting a $1.2 million bonus because Marlboro invested in 35 percent into their company, which sucks because I was just about to work there after almost getting through their rigorous interview process. This investment makes Juul more valuable than SpaceX, which is hilarious because it shows nicotine addictions are way cooler than figuring out the universe we live in.

It was a crisp evening of fall, I was hitting the seasonal flavor of mango at the time if I remember correctly. The dress code was a Hawaiian shirt with three buttons left open to show some tasteful chest hair along with salmon chubbies with a vineyard vine belt. Naturally, I was in my element and confident.

I walked into a dark room and sat there patiently until all of a sudden a blue strobe light started flashing and Mo Bamba started playing. As I waited on my barstool chair, 3 guys walked in wearing professional suits from waist up and those lulu shorts with the liner on the inside from waist down, which was weird because they were like 30 years old. I showed them the projections I made for their company showing that they would be worth more than Apple and Amazon combined in 3 months and they were happy with the numbers, but next came the physical interview.

One of the interviewers whipped out a Juul, said take a hit, and I did because I’m not a bitch and I’m always down for a free rip. It was menthol.
The other interviewer next to him then goes “yo is that a juul, can I hit that?”
I, being part of the top 1% of intellectuals, knew this was a test so I said “nah it’s not mine it’s one of my boys”.

I passed round 1, but what came next is scarred into my brain forever. Literally. I literally have short to long term brain tissue damage from the nicotine intake that came in round 2. They upped the level to 100 nic by making me hit 2 juuls at once.

I had boarded the space craft and I was off to the moon.

They then took 2 more Juuls and tied them together with a hair band that smelt like it came from a girl that went to South Padre for spring break and just … stayed there instead of coming home. I hit the quadfecto, knowing it may be my last breath. As I released the flavored nicotine, I let up a slight cough and they beat me with a paddle and didn’t give me the job.

Now that I think about it, I don’t think it was an actual interview for Juul Labs because it was in a basement of an Arbys. I don’t even think it was a Juul I was hitting because they made me hit the pod out of a glass bowl and I felt buzzed for like 3 hours.

Crack. I probably did crack. Sue me.

Key Takeaway: If you want to get a job at Juul Labs, you just have to be willing to step out of your comfort zone and try new things! You might even learn more about yourself along the way!
