 Domain names are a really weird concept. I stumbled across my first domain name hosting site after seeing a really hot GoDaddy commercial with Danica Patrick. I definitely went to the site knowing it was for domain names and definitely for no other reasons. Was I disappointed the website had nothing to do with what the commercials were about? No because my intellectual appetite was more hungry than my bodily ones and I was introduced to the world of extremely overpriced words with “.com” at the end of them.

Last week I said “fuck it” and went to see if there were any domain names I could buy just in case I could get really rich with a good idea one day.

After seeing “anus.info” was worth more than $1000, my dreams of providing daily informative facts on the human body quickly diminished. “anus.charity” was available for only 30 bucks, but what am I going to do with that? Trust me I thought of literally every option and 90% of them are illegal and barely worth trying. The Make-A-Wish foundation was NOT interested in a collaboration, so I was lost. At this point I was looking for literally anything. No I’m serious. “literallyanything.org” was $15 but those parameters were way too wide for me to do anything with them.


Guyfieri.men? $600. The other option there was “guyfieri.space”, but again what am I going to do with that? Upload pictures of Guy Fieri shoving ribs up his ass on Jupiter and try to enter the online porn industry?

Frustrated, I finally put on my favorite song “Sicko Mode” by Travis Scott, I don’t know if any of you have heard of it, It’s a pretty deep cut. I hopelessly entered “sickomode” into the search bar and there it was… sickomode.org for only 10 dollars. This was right behind “sickomode.clinic” for $60, which is a domain name obviously for people dying of terminal illnesses that want one last mosh pit before they enter whatever afterlife they believed in during their whole mortal existence.

10 dollars? What’s that to me? I have an iPhone 6 with an extended charging cable that I bought from a mall kiosk, I’m fucking rich.

Anyways I bought the domain name without know what I’m going to do with it so I decided I’m going to let out all of my thoughts that inevitable lead me to my own self demise until I think of something better. Hope you guys stay along for the journey!
