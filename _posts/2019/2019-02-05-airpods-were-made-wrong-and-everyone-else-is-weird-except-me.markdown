I’m a normal person. I swear to god I am normal and do normal things. Besides my abnormally delayed puberty everything about me has been normal except for the fact that… I wear my right airpod in my left ear and my left airpod in my right ear. I have lost friends, family members, and potential significant others due to this quirk of mine and I’m going to take you through the journey of it.

I wanted airpods early last summer before they were cool because I’m really good at riding waves. I walk into the apple store excited, but nervous because I knew their headphones never fit me. I tried the airpods on and just knew that they would fall out, but I bought them anyways because I’m not poor and I thought people would finally like me if I walked around with them in.

The next month was probably the hardest time that any human has had to go through ever throughout the existence of mankind, including all wars and genocides. Every 5 steps I took I had to push my airpod back in my ear like a fricken idiot. I couldn’t listen to lil uzi vert without a constant disruption due to the fit of my airpods, which is ultimately why lil uzi quit making music.

During my severe depression I pulled out my airpods and put them in my ear. 5 steps…10 step… 20 steps… they weren’t falling out? I was running back and forth in the parking garage of my extremely lucrative internship trying to see if my airpods were actually fitting right. A bunch of hot girls recorded me doing this because they were so happy for my success. Later I found out that they had posted the video on the internet to make fun of me so I got their sorority shut down for cyber bullying. Everything was finally working out.

Shortly after this, I discovered that I had put them in wrong and got really sad, but you know what? “Wrong” is relative. Some people think it’s “wrong” when you steal or hit people, but if you’re stealing something cool or hitting someone you don’t like it isn’t really “wrong”. At the end of the day, just be confident in how you wear your airpods because at least you know you're better than the other 99% of the world that can’t afford them.
