Ah thanksgiving, the year we all get together and eat the dryest meat on planet earth by dousing it with meat sauce and sliding it down our esophaguses.

But that's not the point. The point is that we all get together and forget all the shit we hate and just think about what we’re thankful for, which is great! For example, today I was thankful that I had Thanksgiving dinner away from one of my uncles who in highschool when I was prepubescent and bordering an obesity crisis, asked me in front of the entire family if I played sports, as if he was going to introduce me to the world of healthy living and change my life forever. In a way, he actually did because from that moment, I made it a mission to get absolutely jacked and beat the shit out of him in front of our family. I’m currently pushing 250 on the bench, but I won’t execute until I’m pushing at least 300.

Anyways, I think Thanksgiving is great to make you feel grateful and happy for all the good things in our lives. That being said, I think we also need a day to ground us from flying too high. We can call it “PainGivings” where we all just sit together with people we hate and just eat slime shit and yell at ourselves in the mirror. We can text every toxic person in our life to come back for just 24 hours. We can text our ex significant others to outline every shitty thing about us until we curl up into a ball and reflect over our qualms. The only thing we can drink are 4 Lokos (Blue Razz). We then will have a huge fire and sacrifice 1 thing that we care about greatly to burn. This can either be a favorite article of clothing or an individual that you love/cherish. After the bonfire, we hit craigslist for used mattress pads to sleep in the basement of the nearest Applebees while using couch cushions as blankets and wearing jeans.

BUT, the next day we come out stronger and better from all the things we’ve learned. All the shit your ex significant other spewed at you? You’ll use it as fuel to get a way hotter significant other that may eventually also break your heart, or maybe not, but if they do, it’ll hurt less because they were hotter and you’re still on an upward progression. The blue razz 4 Lokos? Your body is now stronger and can handle other toxins with ease. Sacrificing something you love? Now you can fill that void with something new, and who knows, maybe it’ll be better than what you had before and you’d just gotten too comfortable!

At the end of the day, everything I’ve described above is basically how I live my life every day so let’s just all do it together instead of just me. I’m basically Thanos at this point.

~Happy Thanksgiving~
~I’m back~
