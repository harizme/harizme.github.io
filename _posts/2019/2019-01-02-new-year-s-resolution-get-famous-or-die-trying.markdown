description: In 2019, I don’t want materialistic or health-related resolutions. Not because I’m “above them”, but because I’ve already conquered those goals in my lifetime. In 2019, all I want is to be famous.

For the last 21 years of my life, every new year’s resolution I have made has come true. When I was 5 I made the resolution to get healthier. By the end of that year I pulled up to kindergarten with a six pack and my teacher refused to make eye contact with me because I could kick his ass. When I was 12 I made the resolution to become rich. That year I was the Founder and CEO of a fortune 500 company. It was an e-commerce platform that initially only sold books, but then eventually expanded to any item that you could think of. It was acquired by someone name Jeff Bezos that year and was rebranded to “Amazon”. When I was 17 my new year’s resolution was to hit puberty. By the end of that year I was shaving once every 2 weeks. Everything I aimed to do ended up happening.

By the end of the year 2019, I want to be famous. I want people paying me $100 just to make a 30 second cameo video of me pretending to give a fuck about them from my studio apartment in LA where all I have in my fridge is a half full carton of almond milk and a bag of kale that I won’t even look at for the next several weeks. I want that dude “Billy on the Street” running around the streets of New York asking people if they know who I am and then calling them swine if they don’t know. I want paparazzi killing any thing/person that gets in their way of trying to find out every facet of my life. I want them to try to figure out, down to the second, when I took my first shit of the day, and I don’t care if children get hurt during their pursuit for that information. I want people from my high school to call me a piece of shit like they used to back in the day, except this time I’ll be famous and it'll hurt slightly less. I want to get a girlfriend (hard part) and then make her break up with me (easy part: I’ll just take my shirt off or something), just so I can say that I’m “just flexin’ on my ex” when I get famous. I also want to make a lot of money because I guess I “significantly undervalued” Amazon when I sold it to Jeff Bezos for $40 and a pack of cigs. I have lost a considerable amount of money. I think this is a very humble, modest, and doable resolution so I’m excited to see where 2019 takes me!

This resolution kinda benefits you guys (sickomode.org: health and wellness awareness community) as well because you can see my progression through fame throughout the year. You can watch me slowly cut out the ones that truly make me happy as I get lost in my own immediate gratification. What if I just ended up completely self-destructing and crumble back to an abyss that’s even lower than where I started? Lol that would be so crazy 😂😧😂 I guess we’ll just have to find out 🙈🙈🙈 wish me luck!

Also please for god’s sake can you readers not be completely and utterly useless and actually try to help me get famous? I swear to god sometimes I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall of numbness and pain. Thank you for the support though!
