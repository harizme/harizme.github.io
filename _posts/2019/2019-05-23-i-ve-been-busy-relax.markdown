As the tweet above shows, I've had a considerable amount of free time recently.

A lot of you have been asking where I’ve been. Every day I get 400 DMs on Instagram from my fans wondering if I’m ok and telling me that they miss/love me and that they haven’t been able to carry out their daily tasks without knowing about my wellbeing and that I seem nice and that we should talk more.

Honestly, I’ve been busy doing stupid shit that really shouldn’t be taking up as much mental real estate as it did, mental real estate that I should’ve been dedicating to this potential multi-million-dollar platform. Basically, I had to “graduate” and do “exceptionally well” in all my courses to live up to my standard as a “model academic scholar/influencer for younger generations for the years to come”. So pathetic.

I need to be better at managing my time, especially for something as important as sickomode.org, so I apologize for that. If I don’t properly manage what I dedicate my life to, how can I make time for things that really matter? Like finding love? The only thing that is in the way of me and finding my extremely hot significant other that’ll inevitably divorce me is my dedication to my life goals. Literally nothing else. I literally have no other qualm that is in the way of finding love. Nothing. Not one thing. Trust me I have not tried and failed countless times. Honestly, if I dedicated my time to finding a significant other (which I haven’t at all not even one bit not even remotely obviously, which is why I’m alone), I would probably be dating the love of my life who, again, would divorce me at 40, which I’m cool with because she would probably be making more money than me because it’s 2019 and women are capable of doing that and also because I’m dumb. Have fun paying for my juul pods through child support 😂🤣😂. Not my fault you didn’t have our kid solely for expecting an impending divorce 😂🤣😂.

Regardless, I’ll be more active in sharing my thoughts on this platform because I want to and not because my family and friends think it’s a great outlet for me to express my feelings in a low risk environment for me to get hurt.

So excited!
