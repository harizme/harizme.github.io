Alright, I’m not going to lie to you. This is not an application from the App Store and there is a reason for that and it is NOT because I was too lazy and poor to go through apple’s process.

Did you know that Apple kills an orphan child for every app that is downloaded from the Appstore? At least 100 million orphan children have been killed just this year, which is double the amount of causalities from World War II.

 Instead, I have a much better an orphan-friendly way to get this app on your iPhone (works for androids too, but I don’t really associate myself with poor people, but please download anyways!). The steps are listed below

1.	Go to sickomode.org on your phone
2.	Click the “share” icon below
3.	Click “add to home screen”
4.	Show me a form undeserved affection (example: a hug)

And that is all, no orphans injured throughout this entire process.
